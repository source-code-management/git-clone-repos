$gitlab_api     --> this is for GitLab repos list
$repo_date      --> use this variable to filter the results by date. the date format is YYYY-MM-DD, you can insert it all or even a part, eg. 2022 or 2022-05. if you don't want any filter you can put "date" as value
$excluded_group --> use it to exclude one organization/group from the list. if you don't want any filter you must put a random word as value eg. "pippo"
$base_dir       --> specify where you want all the cloned repos
